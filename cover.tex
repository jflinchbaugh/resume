\opening{Dear Sir;}

I'm submitting this r\'esum\'e
in response to your posting
to Usenet.
I am very interested
in the opportunity
to work with your company
in the coming months.

I have over two years
of administration experience,
and a year in Solaris specifically.
I've run Sparcs
on the Millersville University
campus, where I am a student.
I've recently joined the
administration team for
the computer science department,
where I help support
a lab of Sparc workstations
and servers.

I look forward to hearing from you.
Feel free to mail, e-mail, or telephone.

Thank you.

\closing{Regards,}
\end{letter}
